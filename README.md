# Producer Consumer Problem

ðŸš€ Introduction
=================
The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic problem this is used for multi-process synchronization i.e. synchronization between more than one processes.

In the producer-consumer problem, there is one Producer that is producing something and there is one Consumer that is consuming the products produced by the Producer. The producers and consumers share the same memory buffer that is of fixed-size.

The job of the Producer is to generate the data, put it into the buffer, and again start generating data. While the job of the Consumer is to consume the data from the buffer.

What's the problem here?
-----------------
The following are the problems that might occur in the Producer-Consumer:
* The producer should produce data only when the buffer is not full. If the buffer is full, then the producer shouldn't be allowed to put any data into the buffer.
* The consumer should consume data only when the buffer is not empty. If the buffer is empty, then the consumer shouldn't be allowed to take any data from the buffer.
* The producer and consumer should not access the buffer at the same time.

# Dining Philosopher Problem

ðŸš€ Introduction
=================
The Dining Philosopher Problem states that K philosophers seated around a circular table with one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pickup the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both.
